### Work Experience
**Lead Data Scientist @ Rappi**

I was part of the Global Unit of Artificial Intelligence of Rappibank (Fintech)
- Managed a team of data scientists and ML engineers, focusing on Customer Risk Management and business analytics projects.
- Collaborated with company business teams to design and implement 12 ML models, boosting business KPIs in areas like churn, sales, growth, collections, profitability, LTV, claims, and credit risk (models applied to +600k banking customers and +30M Rappi prospects).
- Launched a global RFM user segmentation, providing insights into evolving customer purchasing behavior for informed decision-making.
- Developed ML models to automate 50% of claim responses in Mexico, and to identify +1M of high-profile potential customers in Colombia.
- Developed an anomaly detector for real-time tracking of customer claim causes, aiding same-day issue resolution by the service team.
- Conducted and monitored AB testing experiments, evaluating model impact on product performance.
-	Built a lookalike model to identify new potential users for Rappi’s travel agency, helping management to identify a $50M opportunity
- Built an ETL with Airflow to collect and store customer interactions, serving as a foundation for future models and product initiatives.


**Software Development Engineer Intern @ Amazon**

I interned in Amazon Ads during my MS program at UCSD, collaborating in the Analytics and Data Management team.
- Designed architecture changes for a KPI monitoring tool, enhancing ad campaign analytics (clicks, conversion, etc.) for Amazon Ads clients. 
- Developed a website for Ads account managers, utilizing DynamoDB, AppSync, CDK, and Typescript for Terabytes of GraphQL ads data.
- Developed an AWS SageMaker-based MLOps pipeline, ready to be replicated for future model deployments with Ads data.


**Senior Data Scientist @ Rimac Seguros (Insurance)**

I was part of the Division of Artificial Intelligence of the insurance company, focused on customer analytics, pricing and computer vision.
- Managed 3 data scientists of the Computer Vision squad for vehicle inspection and damage recognition projects for auto insurance. Used deep learning for object detection (YOLO) and image segmentation (UNET) to automate 100% of the insurance’s inspection process.
- Defined guidelines and procedures for the data pipeline (collection, labeling, quality control) for computer vision projects.
-	Built classification and regression ML models for personalized risk-based pricing in auto insurance, leading to a revenue boost of +$500K.
- Developed interpretable ML models to predict policy claims and customer churn, resulting in a 15% churn reduction in health insurance.
-	Conducted analysis of customer and product data, offering key insights that guided management to design effective pricing strategies.
-	Deployed models using AWS, conducted A/B tests for performance evaluation, and consistently monitored models in production.



**Data Analytics Consultant @ Ernst & Young (EY)**

I served as a consultant for the financial services office (FSO).
- Provided advisory services to international financial companies (banking/insurance) within the advanced analytics consulting team.
- Developed a pricing methodology incorporating a credit risk-of-default prediction model and AB testing, applied to two banks in Peru.
- Developed strategies for optimizing credit card revenue, contributing to a $10M financial revenue boost for Scotiabank Mexico and Peru.

### Professional Projects

**Portfolio of ML Projects**
  - Customer churn prediction model
  - Customer claim detector model
  - Credit card risk of default prediction model
  - Credit card profitability model
  - Loan interest estimation by optimization
  - Auto insurance financial revenue estimation with time series
  - Probability of policy claims in auto and health insurance
  - Personalized pricing for insurance products (auto and health)
  - Customer life time value estimation (CLV)
  - Anomaly detector in customer contacts to customer service


### Academic Projects
**Development of a Recommender System**
- Building a Recommender System model using collaborative filtering and latent-factor models to predict the ratings that users would give to different books (items).

**Stock prediction with multimodal datasets**
- Building a model using data stock time series data, financial indicators, and news data using text embeddings (Word2Vec, Top2Vec) for the dataset consolidation and LSTM and Generative Adversarial Networks for modeling experiments

**Causal Discovery using Lagged Time series for economic data**
- Processed economic indicators' time series data from various countries, managed multicollinearity, and employed causal inference algorithms to identify causal relationships and displaying causal DAGs among indicators across multiple years.

**Multimodal Data Analysis for Academic Publications**
- Created a reporting tool by populating structured (PostgreSQL) and unstructured databases (MongoDB, Neo4j) with publication and research investment data. The tool retrieves information from these three sources, facilitating efficient on-demand report generation.
